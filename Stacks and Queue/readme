Lets learn stacks and queues

stacks follow lifo(last in first out)
queues follow fifo(first in first out)

in this part we will see how to implement stack and queue using array and linked list
also see how to implement stack wuing queue adn queue using stack

then we will see infix, prefix and postfix in stacks and queues

then lastly solving problems on s&q.
