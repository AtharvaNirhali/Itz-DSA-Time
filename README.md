# Itz-DSA-Time
DSA is pretty important in the life of a CS Engineer. 
After successfully wasting 4 years of my B.E. I am finally starting my DSA journey.
Hello there, I am Atharva Nirhali, a M.Tech Data Science Student at PICT Pune.
In this repository I will be posting all the DSA related code and readme files for future me and maybe for you who is reading this readme.
All the DSA will be done from striver.

Thank you and Letzzzz Go!!!!!!
